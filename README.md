Data Preprocessing
Standardize or normalize features, handle missing values (if any), and split the data into training and test sets.

Model Training
Train one or more machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN) using the training set.

Evaluation
Use performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to assess how well the model generalizes.

Prediction
Take new sample inputs, preprocess them in the same way, and feed them into the trained model to get a prediction.
